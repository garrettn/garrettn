# Hi, Iâ€™m Garrett

Iâ€™m a web developer, frontend developer, or UI engineer, depending on who you ask. Basically I make things that people can use on the web. My day job revolves around making JavaScript applications, which Iâ€™ve been doing for a few years. My interests go beyond JavaScript too.

## Some Things I Care About

When it comes to working on the web, some things get me especially fired up:

* **Accessibility**â€”Making web experiences the best they can be for all kinds of users.
* **Privacy**â€”Allowing users to choose what data they share and providing a good experience without invasive tracking.
* **Data ownership**â€”Giving users complete control over what happens to their data, even if it means taking it out of your app.
* **Honesty**â€”Being clear with users, not tricking them into things they didnâ€™t choose.
* **Openness**â€”Sharing and cooperating with the community, making it better for everyone.
* **Decentralization**â€”Letting the web belong to everyone, not just a few big companies.
* **Kindness**â€”Recognizing other people as people and not treating them like enemies. Assuming the best of others.

## Some Things Iâ€™m Intersted In

Not an exhaustive list, but these are some of the things Iâ€™m thinking about nowadays.

* [**Jamstack**](https://jamstack.org/)â€”Iâ€™m still dipping my toes in here but itâ€™s a philosophy that makes sense to me, and it just seems like a fun way to develop.
* [**Indieweb**](https://indieweb.org/)â€”I feel like this movement (if you can call it that) really captures what makes the web so cool.
* [**Functional programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)â€”Iâ€™ve dabbled in some FP languages and try to bring some of those principles to JS. But I want to learn more about languages that are actually built for it.
* [**Finite state machines**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)â€”This is one of those things where once you learn about it, it seems like the solution to every problem. [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) is an amazing statechart library. I still have a lot to learn here, but I love it so far.
* [**Progressive web apps**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)â€”Itâ€™s amazing what web apps are capable of now. This is so much more interesting to me than native apps.
* [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)â€”Itâ€™s often an afterthought in frontend web development, but there is so much to learn here! Especially with how powerful itâ€™s become over the past few years.
* [**React**](https://reactjs.org/)â€”Not exactly new or unique anymore, but it still is fun to work with. Itâ€™s currently what I use professionally.
* **Writing and teaching**â€”I love to share what I learn. Iâ€™m searching for a way to combine my love of web developpment with my love of writing and teaching in one career. Iâ€™m still working on getting my blog back up and running, but I have written [a few old articles](https://www.garrettnay.com/blog/better-redux-selectors-with-ramda/) [that I'm](https://www.garrettnay.com/blog/css-grid-is-great/) [still proud of](https://www.garrettnay.com/blog/use-javascript-proxies-to-debug-changes-to-objects/).


## Some Things I Made

Most of the work I do professionally is closed-source, unfortunately, but check out my pinned repositories for some of the silly things Iâ€™ve made in my spare time.
