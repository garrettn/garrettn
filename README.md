# Hi, Iâ€™m Garrett

Iâ€™m a web developer, frontend developer, or UI engineer, depending on who you ask. Basically I make things that people can use on the web. My day job revolves around making JavaScript applications, which Iâ€™ve been doing for a few years. My interests go beyond JavaScript too.

## Some Things I Care About

When it comes to working on the web, some things get me especially fired up:

* **Accessibility**â€”Making web experiences the best they can be for all kinds of users.
* **Privacy**â€”Giving good experiences without tracking users everywhere and making them sell their soul.
* **Data ownership**â€”Giving users complete control over what happens to their data.
* **Honesty**â€”Being clear with users, not tricking them into things they didnâ€™t choose.
* **Openness**â€”Sharing and cooperating with the community, making it better for everyone.
* **Decentralization**â€”Letting the web belong to everyone, not just a few big companies.
* **Kindness**â€”Recognizing other people as people and not treating them like enemies.

## Some Things Iâ€™m Intersted In

Not an exhaustive list, but these are some of the things Iâ€™m thinking about nowadays.

* [**Jamstack**](https://jamstack.org/)â€”Iâ€™m still dipping my toes in here but itâ€™s a philosophy that makes sense to me, and it just seems like a fun way to develop.
* [**Indieweb**](https://indieweb.org/)â€”I feel like this movement (if you can call it that) really captures what makes the web so cool.
* **Functional programming**â€”Iâ€™ve dabbled in some FP languages and try to bring some of those principles to JS. But I want to learn more about languages that are actually built for it.
* [**Progressive web apps**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)â€”Itâ€™s amazing what web apps are capable of now. This is so much more interesting to me than native apps.
* **CSS**â€”Itâ€™s often an afterthought in frontend web development, but there is so much to learn here! Especially with how powerful itâ€™s become over the past few years.
* **React**â€”Not exactly new or unique anymore, but it still is fun to work with. Itâ€™s currently what I use professionally.
* **Writing and teaching**â€”I love to share what I learn. Iâ€™m searching for a way to combine my love of web developpment with my love of writing and teaching in one career.


## Some Things I Made

Most of the work I do professionally is closed-source, unfortunately, but check out my pinned repositories for some of the silly things Iâ€™ve made in my spare time.
