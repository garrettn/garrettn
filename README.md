# Hi, Iâ€™m Garrett

Iâ€™m a web developer, frontend developer, or UI engineer, depending on who you ask. Basically I make things that people can use on the web. My day job revolves around making JavaScript applications, but I also love making content-focused sites like the one you see here. I love the indie spirit of the web.

## Some Things I Care About

When it comes to working on the web, some things get me especially fired up:

* **Accessibility**â€”Making web experiences the best they can be for all kinds of users.
* **Privacy**â€”Giving good experiences without tracking users everywhere and making them sell their soul.
* **Data ownership**â€”Giving users complete control over what happens to their data.
* **Honesty**â€”Being clear with users, not tricking them into things they didnâ€™t choose.
* **Openness**â€”Sharing and cooperating with the community, making it better for everyone.
* **Decentralization**â€”Letting the web belong to everyone, not just a few big companies.
* **Kindness**â€”Recognizing other people as people and not treating them like enemies.

## Some Things I Made

Most of the work I do professionally is closed-source, unfortunately, but check out my pinned repositories for some of the silly things Iâ€™ve made in my spare time.
